### Task 1: Disassembling Sensors
#### 1.1 Disassmebling the interior
 - Disconnect USBs and other wires
 - Unscrew the circuit boards from the sensor
 - Take out SD cards
 - Sort out parts into separate piles
#### 1.2 Disassembling exterior
 - Unscrew the lid of the sensor
 - Take out wires
 - Take apart the solar shields
 - Take out the circuit board and the wires

### Task 2: Try out the Arduino
#### 2.1 Set up Arduino Development Envioronment
 - Go to the web development editor [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and create an account
 - Download the Arduino Create plugin [here](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin?page=2)
#### 2.2 Do the first exercise
 - Write the following code in the editor:
````
/*
// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
   // print out a String of your choice 
  Serial.println("Hello MINTS: Multi-scale Integrated Sensing and Simulation");
  // Delay for 1000 miliseconds 
  delay(1000);        // delay in between reads for stability
    }
````
 - The serial monitor will now print "Hello MINTS: Multi-scale Integrated Sensing and Simulation" on loop
#### 2.3 Do another exercise
 - Change the code to:
 ````
 void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(500);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(500);                       // wait for a second
}
````
 - The LED light now flashes every half second
 #### 2.4 Exercise 4
 - Try the following:
  ````
 // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // Delay for 1000 miliseconds 
  if(random(1, 10) > 5)
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  else
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(200);
}
````
